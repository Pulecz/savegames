# Cities Skylines save1-Cannville

Savegames with mod list.

I did 9 saves total until I decided to just use one file master-cannvile.crp which first's commit is from same date as 08_sixth_milestone_bigtown_ad.crp.
This file will be overwritten each time from later saves. Each commit marking 09 and 10 and etc.
The idea is to have each commit as a certain time in game.

The older files were removed, it may be possible to found them in early commits.

See in folder for city progress log and used mods.

How was it made?
Using Camera Positions Utility (ID=898480258) and HideUI (ID=406326408)
I set up 5 (and later added more) positions so far and then from time to time I just switch to each one and make a screenshot using steam
which creates both compressed jpg in steam folder and png in useradata.
I could use to have reminded that in game time passed like half a year so its time to make screenshots.
But just keeping the idea that something changed a lot, so its time to make screenshots is enough imho.

Camera positions:

* 1 - near the towns first roundabout
* 2 - same, but bit zoomed out
* 3 - again same, but way further
* 4 - centered at first roundabout but from opposite direction and at low angle
* 5 - zoomed out, up is west
* 6 - similar to 3, pointing south east
* 9 - maximum meaningful zoom, up is north

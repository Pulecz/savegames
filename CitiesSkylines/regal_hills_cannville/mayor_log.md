## Roads
###### Recommended mods for building road:
* Precision Engineering (ID=445589127)
* Pause on load (ID=408905948) 

Every Mayor knows that at the beginning of the game, the game should be paused and then
roads have to be built, since many buildings want to be near them.
In more detail, cars need to go in the city from the highway and then back.
So roundabout is good first option for lower traffic.

Make sure to designate residential and industrial area away from each other.
You might want to choose a direction for the roundabout so industrial trucks/tractors
stay on the roundabout the least time and when they are done in the area,
leave the city the shortest way, perhaps with a new connection to highway.

That will be future plans for this city when the industrial area will grow though.

For residential area, grid will probably work best, although you might want to
do some curves and spaces in between and join them with pathways later.

But first save some for money for **water** and **electricity**.

## Water

There is river on this map, so let's just drain clean water from the upper flow
and then the 'used water' from the city will be pumped bellow.

If you don't have water area, you might use water towers, but no idea where to
dump the 'used water', probably make a hole?

With Precision Engineering mod helpers you should be able to spread out water pipes
in a nice grid by watching the blue circle where it has effects.
There is some recommended length between them.

## Power

Wind or Coal?

If you have windy areas you can generate up to 8MW (and perhaps 10MW if used at 150%).
But you might just want to go with coal power plant in industrial area.

For this city it was wind and even if industrial will pollute at first, when
districts will be unlocked, it will be farmland.

With electricity and water provided, all what is left to do is lower the budget for both services
and build roads for rest of the money so RCI zones can be set.

## Unpause
For Cannville the residential area was first exit at the roundabout followed by way to the city
and finally big soon to be farmland.
460 people were quite quick to arrive, so first milestone and schools and garbage had to be built.
School had a place with new grid nearer to the highway and garbage had extension near the future farmland at the edge of the city.
And yes, doctors near the roundabout in residential arena.
After another milestone, time for districts and finally throw out the general industry and put in the farmlands!
Police and Firefighters in the center of it all on the roundabout.
More people want to go in the city, so bridge over the water build was build and new residential area with spaces for parks built!

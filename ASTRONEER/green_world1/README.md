# Version 0.6.8.0

# script birth

So I spent 5 hours on this new version (15h ASTRONEERing total so far) and I realized there is no steam cloud and I wanna move my files.

So few edits to the bash helper script:

* %LOCALAPPDATA%\Astro\Saved\SaveGames - where autosaves are
* 361420 - Steam ID to find screenshots with, expected path for future steam cloud
* just name_map is used - considering there are no names in game yet, this should be omitted as well perhaps

# Space log 2018/05/07

Things are going well, researched already like 14k points or so, so there is already medium battery researched, built 2 of them, one for medium rover (costed like 2750 rp, worth it), other for the base.

Base has many things:
2 research pads
1 vehicle assembly
1 smelter
1 small printer
1 medium printer
1 mineral extractor (soil eater)
x I forgot (#FIXME)

At least 3 caves entrance are tethered, some even joined already.

Good map, about 7k of rp points now, probably time to fly to space.

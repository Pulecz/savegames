# Version 0.6.8.0

# script birth

So I spent 5 hours on this new version (15h ASTRONEERing total so far) and I realized there is no steam cloud and I wanna move my files.

So few edits to the bash helper script:

* %LOCALAPPDATA%\Astro\Saved\SaveGames - where autosaves are
* 361420 - Steam ID to find screenshots with, expected path for future steam cloud
* just name_map is used - considering there are no names in game yet, this should be omitted as well perhaps

Things are going well, researched already like 14k points or so, so there is already medium battery researched, built 2 of them, one for medium rover (costed like 2750 rp, worth it), other for the base.

Base has many things:

* 2 research pads
* 1 vehicle assembly
* 1 smelter
* 1 small printer
* * 1 medium printer
* 1 mineral extractor (soil eater)
* x I forgot (#FIXME)

At least 3 caves entrance are tethered, some even joined already.

Good map, about 7k of rp points now, probably time to fly to space.

We flown to Tundra, well it took additional RPs to research "fuel maker", but I could have just invested more in fuel condenser, which somehow seems to work for free.

We got loads of titanium, not sure what for, copper and alliminium seems common as well, but not so much compound and resin, which is needed for establishing new base on Tundra planet or Exotic or any other.

I often get very easillly desioriented, even though I sort of know what place is what depending on the direction (N S W E).

This game needs some proper ballancing for sure, its fun and super chill though!

**NOTE:** since autosave games always keep changing names, lets just rename them to ${name_map} variable, so we don't get tons of files, only just same file names for specific commits

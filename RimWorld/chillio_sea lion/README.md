# The start - 2018/02/11 - 1st of Aprimay 5500

Group of five tribal started journey in 770m I guess tropical biome with all year round growing possible.

As usual from DF book, good position rock with plenty of space was picked and diging started, few most critical stockpiles created[screen_0002-0003].

Food is low, must hunt[screen_0001], all the things. Two closeby turkeys could be tameable though.

Beds can be made only from cloth, 50 per one, 5 people, uff. Sleep on the floor now.

Sustainable food level is critical now, butcher workshop and food stove built for that.

First night, first commit.

# First week - 2018/02/11 afternoon - 7th of Aprimay 5500

The tribe:
* Alligator - healer, heals and does some stuff
* Black - shaman, builder, digger etc.
* Emu - tribal, bruiser
* Rhino - keeper, manages stuff
* Tasca - digger, builder
* Manic - Warg
* Tinkertoy - Labrador retriever
* Homeboy - cat

Black suggested the name of the faction should be "Bral√°n Hill", nope, "Chillio".

Community name is perfect tho - "**The Trogo of the Tree**".

All of pemmican is gone, its just meat now, no plants yet.
Daily hunts of at least 2 mid-size animals are needed.

Simple cooker built with infinite simple meal task.
The butcher's table has to be moved to a outside shed perhaps, its not 'beautiful' enough to stay indoors.

Another potato field, rice haygrass and corn field created[screen_0004].

Game said pirates might be coming, so sandbags built, as long as some deadfall traps, we will see if they will not work against us.

## Screens
_TODO_insert_them_

Had a failure, Emu got attacked by emu, reload[screen_0005].

Seen 50 old emu![screen_0006]

Tasca and aligator have their own 'rooms' now[screen_0007].

We ate a boomrat[screen_0008].

Emu killed a buck with few shots[screen_0009].

Visitors came, but surelly they weren't happy with Emu insulting them[screen_0010].

Pirates did came but not before flashstorm started[screen_0011] and the corner where one pirate appeared[screen_0012]  was in flames, fool got burned[screen_0013] , only little though.

Eventually he attacked with his awful (28%) pistol, we were ready so few arrows flew, but shaman came at him with jade knife, got few bruises, but the stupid guy was knocked down.
And executed. Burried later.

By end of the week[screen_0014] , thinks seem to getting better, everybody should have own room and not too ugly room, (which they switch often between themselves (unnasign all beds)) and first batch of potatos is half done.
But the pirates, that will be some challenge (actuall difficulty).

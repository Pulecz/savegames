# The start - 2018/02/11 - 1st of Aprimay 5500

Group of five tribal started journey in 770m I guess tropical biome with all year round growing possible.

As usual from DF book, good position rock with plenty of space was picked and diging started, few most critical stockpiles created[screen_0002-0003].

Food is low, must hunt[screen_0001], all the things. Two closeby turkeys could be tameable though.

Beds can be made only from cloth, 50 per one, 5 people, uff. Sleep on the floor now.

Sustainable food level is critical now, butcher workshop and food stove built for that.

First night, first commit.

# First week - 2018/02/11 afternoon - 7th of Aprimay 5500

Black suggested the name of the faction should be "Bral√°n Hill", nope, "Chillio".

Community name is perfect tho - "**The Trogo of the Tree**".

All of pemmican is gone, its just meat now, no plants yet.
Daily hunts of at least 2 mid-size animals are needed.

Simple cooker built with infinite simple meal task.
The butcher's table has to be moved to a outside shed perhaps, its not 'beautiful' enough to stay indoors.

Another potato field, rice haygrass and corn field created[screen_0004].

Game said pirates might be coming, so sandbags built, as long as some deadfall traps, we will see if they will not work against us.

## Screens
_TODO_insert_them_

Had a failure, Emu got attacked by emu, reload[screen_0005].

Seen 50 old emu![screen_0006]

Tasca and aligator have their own 'rooms' now[screen_0007].

We ate a boomrat[screen_0008].

Emu killed a buck with few shots[screen_0009].

Visitors came, but surelly they weren't happy with Emu insulting them[screen_0010].

Pirates did came but not before flashstorm started[screen_0011] and the corner where one pirate appeared[screen_0012]  was in flames, fool got burned[screen_0013] , only little though.

Eventually he attacked with his awful (28%) pistol, we were ready so few arrows flew, but shaman came at him with jade knife, got few bruises, but the stupid guy was knocked down.
And executed. Burried later.

By end of the week[screen_0014] , thinks seem to getting better, everybody should have own room and not too ugly room, (which they switch often between themselves (unnasign all beds)) and first batch of potatos is half done.
But the pirates, that will be some challenge (actuall difficulty).

# Second week - 2018/04/30 afternoon - 14th of Aprimay 5500 night

By begining of the week some 20y old General Mathew who is incapable of doing dumb labour came running to our tribe, good adition.

Two pirates were chasing them, one dead quick, other even when he was retreating kept running to others, he was captured. The 61y grandpa's name is Frederick and he is brutal anti social, good with weapons though, could be good shield.

Black 37F and Tasca 58M got together[screen_0015] and are getting married soon[screen_0017]! 100of pigskins had to be gathered to build them a bed.

Black also tamed two boomalopes (good for sending them to boom) and one Turkey.

By reading [cheaty Tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/89oszo/list_of_rimworld_tips/) on reddit a hunter zone was made, engulfing the whole map except the stockpile where dead animals should be gathered. This way the hunters (or anyone asigned to that zone) will not pick animals, which might be helpful when hunting for lot of animals. And some other tip was used I guess.

Food is good, first harvests were quickly eaten though, need to be sure to have stock of raw food to cook, some preparations were made for the oncoming freezer, it has critical stockpile for all foods now.
Lots of animals killed though, ppl are hunting like crazy[screen_0016].

First research table was made and Rhino was researching Beds (1400), but Matthew got hold of that, so another table had to made in newly dugged area, gonna need a lot of researching.

Crafting spot was made and some tribalwear was created, I am not sure which part of clothing are some ppl missing, so just gotta stack up. Also the main hall is now fully floored, it still has textile stockpile which was moved to oher room, so ppl consdider it ugly. Sculpters workshop was made, I thought it would be good outside, but there is a restriction so a entrachment for defences was made around it.

And some lone pirate came to attack so Black with knife and Emu (and others) with pistol made quick work of the geologist (good miner), too bad he wasn't captured, but that Frederick is still there, meh.

The pirate appeared on the southwest corner (bottom left) and there is a big room with bad stuff in it[screen_0018]! (game dialog says so)

# Third week - 2018/05/02 - 6th of Jugust

Only one dumb pirate attacked.

Heatwave + eclipse was something else though, 3 ppl collapsed, but were rescued and are fine now.

Manual priority was used, mainly for cleaning, but that left lots of things unattended, such as the prisoner frederic fainting from starvation...

Beds were researched, so no more sleeping on the ground, then brewing, although nobody can grow hops yet, drugs production is next. We gotta sell something.

Construction effort is going ok, outside room with butcher's table was expanded, with a thought of defense place, digging into main mountain slowly continues.

I guess carpet making and some nice stuff should be done after eletricity and cooling. Will see when the end will go mad and send tons of enemies.

Oh and AI showed a location east of our mainland location about a aship[screen_0019]

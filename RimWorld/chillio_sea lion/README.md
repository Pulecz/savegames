# The start - 2018/02/11

Group of five tribal started journey in 770m I guess tropical biome with all year round growing possible.

As usual from DF book, good position rock with plenty of space was picked and diging started, few most critical stockpiles created.

Food is low, must hunt, all the things. Two closeby turkeys could be tameable though.

Beds can be made only from cloth, 50 per one, 5 people, uff. Sleep on the floor now.

Sustainable food level is critical now, butcher workshop and food stove built for that.

First night, first commit.
